# Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning 🩺🤖

🔹This project aims to detect breast cancer using Machine Learning algorithms.

🔹The dataset used in this project is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

🔹The goal of this project is to build an ML model that can accurately classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features such as texture, perimeter, and compactness.

## Dataset 📊

🔹The Breast Cancer Detection project uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

🔹The dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, describing characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Methodology 🔎

🔹The Breast Cancer Detection project follows a structured approach to classify tumors. Key steps include:

1.  **Import Necessary Libraries and Load Data**: Import required libraries and load the dataset.
2.  **Preprocess Data**: Normalize and encode categorical variables.
3.  **Split Data**: Split the data into training and test sets.
4.  **Train Machine Learning Models**: Train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier.
5.  **Evaluate Models' Performance**: Evaluate the models using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
6.  **Select Best Performing Model**: Choose the best performing model for further analysis.
7.  **Analyze Results**: Visualize results with heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots.
8.  **Prepare Final Report**: Document conclusions and recommendations in a final report.
9.  **Present Findings**: Share findings through presentation slides.
