## 📖 Overview
The Handwritten Digit Recognition project aims to accurately identify and classify handwritten digits. This challenge is crucial for various applications, such as automated data entry and postal services. Leveraging the **MNIST dataset**, this project develops a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Accurately recognizing handwritten digits is essential for many automated systems. The variability in handwriting styles presents a significant challenge for traditional recognition methods, leading to decreased accuracy. This project seeks to create a model that effectively learns to distinguish between different handwritten digits.
