# **Covid-19 Prediction Using Machine Learning**

### 🎯 Goal
This project aims to predict whether a person is Covid-19 positive (+ve) or not based on minimal possible symptoms such as fever, cough, age above 60, sore throat, etc.

### 🚀 Models Implemented
We have implemented and evaluated the following machine learning models:

1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
ANNs are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN consists of layers of nodes, each layer fully connected to the next one, capable of learning complex patterns from data.

2. Gradient Boosting
Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees sequentially. Each tree tries to correct the errors of the previous one, resulting in a powerful model that can achieve high predictive accuracy.

3. Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees. It builds multiple decision trees during training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

4. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. It is a simple yet effective method for binary classification problems, such as predicting the presence or absence of a disease.

5. Decision Trees
Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The model predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

### 📈Best Performing Model
Among all the models, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 95.77%.
