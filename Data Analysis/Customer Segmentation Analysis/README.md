# Customer Segmentation Analysis🔍
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. This project aims to analyze customer data to identify meaningful segments that help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer service, and optimize product offerings.

### Objective :

- Understand customer behavior and preferences.
- Identify key segments based on demographics, purchasing habits, or other relevant features.
- Provide insights that can assist in targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and better business decision-making.
### Approach :

- Data Collection & Preprocessing: Collect and clean the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
- Feature Selection: Identify key variables that can help differentiate customer groups, such as age, location, spending habits, and product preferences.
- Clustering Algorithm: Use machine learning techniques (like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.) to segment customers.
- Evaluation & Visualization: Assess the effectiveness of the segmentation and visualize the results for better understanding.
