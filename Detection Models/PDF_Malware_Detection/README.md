# PDF Malware Detection

This project implements a machine learning-based system for detecting potential malware in PDF files. It includes feature extraction from PDF files, model training, and a prediction script for classifying PDFs as potentially malicious or benign.

## Components

1. **Feature Extraction** (`pdf_feature_extraction.py`)
   - Extracts various features from PDF files using PyMuPDF and pdfid.
   - Features include metadata, structural elements, and presence of potentially risky elements.

2. **Model Training** (`pdf_malware_dataset_training.py`)
   - Prepares the dataset, handles data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - Trains a Random Forest classifier for malware detection.
   - Includes code for hyperparameter tuning (commented out).

3. **Prediction Script** (`predict_malware.py`)
   - Uses the trained model to predict whether a given PDF file is potentially malicious.

## Setup

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn imblearn PyMuPDF pdfid joblib
   ```

2. Ensure you have the dataset file `PDFMalware2022.csv` in the `Dataset` folder.

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Run the `pdf_malware_dataset_training.py` script to train the model:
   ```
   python pdf_malware_dataset_training.py
   ```
   This will create a `random_forest_model.pkl` file containing the trained model.

### Predicting Malware

For prediction run the script directly along with path to pdf file:
   ```
   python predict_malware.py path/to/your/pdf_file.pdf
   ```

## Note

This project is for educational and research purposes only. It should not be used as a sole means of determining file safety. Always use caution when dealing with potentially malicious files and consult with cybersecurity professionals for comprehensive security measures.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced feature extraction techniques.
- Explore other machine learning algorithms for potentially better performance.
- Add a user-friendly interface for easier interaction with the prediction system.
- Incorporate regular model updates with new malware samples to keep the detection current.
