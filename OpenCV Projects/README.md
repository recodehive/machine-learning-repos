This Python script leverages OpenCV and a pre-trained SSD MobileNet v3 deep learning model for real-time object detection in video streams. It utilizes the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset for object class recognition.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- OpenCV library: Install via `pip install opencv-python`
- NumPy library: Install via `pip install numpy` (usually included with OpenCV)
- `coco.names` file: Contains class labels for the COCO dataset (download from a reliable source)
- `ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt` file: Model configuration file (download from a reliable source)
- `frozen_inference_graph.pb` file: Model weights file (download from a reliable source)

## Instructions

1. **Download necessary files:**
   - Obtain the `coco.names`, `ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt`, and `frozen_inference_graph.pb` files from a trusted source (ensure compatibility with your OpenCV version). Place them in the same directory as your Python script.

2. **Run the script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your script and files.
   - Execute the script using:
     ```sh
     python object_detection.py
     ```

## Code Breakdown

1. **Imports:**
   - `cv2`: Imports the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.

2. **Threshold and Video Capture:**
   - `thres`: Sets the confidence threshold for object detection (adjust as needed).
   - `cap`: Initializes a video capture object (`VideoCapture(1)`) to access your webcam (or a different video source by providing its index or path).
   - `cap.set()`: Sets video capture properties:
     - `3`: Width (adjust for desired resolution)
     - `4`: Height (adjust for desired resolution)
     - `10`: Brightness (adjust for lighting conditions)

3. **Load Class Names:**
   - `classNames`: Creates an empty list to store object class names.
   - `classFile`: Path to the `coco.names` file.
   - Loads class names from the file and splits them into a list.

4. **Load Model Configuration and Weights:**
   - `configPath`: Path to the `ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt` file.
   - `weightsPath`: Path to the `frozen_inference_graph.pb` file.
   - `net`: Creates a detection model object using `cv2.dnn_DetectionModel()`.
   - Sets model input size, scale, mean, and color channel swapping parameters for compatibility with the model.

5. **Main Loop:**
   - `while True`: Continuously captures frames from the video stream.
   - `success, img`: Reads a frame and checks for success. Exits if unsuccessful.
   - `classIds`, `confs`, `bbox`: Performs object detection using the model on the current frame.
     - `classIds`: List of detected object class IDs.
     - `confs`: List of corresponding confidence scores (0-1).
     - `bbox`: List of bounding boxes (coordinates) for detected objects.
   - Prints detected object IDs and bounding boxes for debugging (optional).

6. **Draw Bounding Boxes and Labels:**
   - Checks if any objects were detected (`len(classIds) != 0`).
   - Iterates through detected objects using `zip`:
     - `box`: Current bounding box coordinates.
     - `classId`: Current object class ID (minus 1 for indexing).
     - `confidence`: Current object confidence score.
   - Draws a green rectangle around the detected object using `cv2.rectangle()`.
   - Displays the corresponding class name (uppercase) and confidence score (rounded to two decimal places) using `cv2.putText()`.

7. **Display and Exit:**
   - `cv2.imshow()`: Displays the processed frame with bounding boxes and labels in a window titled "Output".
   - `cv2.waitKey(1)`: Waits for a key press for 1 millisecond.
   - Exits the loop and releases resources if the 'q' key is pressed.

8. **Cleanup:**
   - Releases the video capture object and closes all OpenCV windows.
     ```python
     cap.release()
     cv2.destroyAllWindows()
     ```
