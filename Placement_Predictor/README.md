# Placement Predictos

 This folder provides the code for placement analysis and an interactive interface for analyzing and visualizing data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

## Introduction

Data analysis is an essential part of modern decision-making processes. With the proliferation of data in various domains, having tools to explore, visualize, and understand data is crucial. This Streamlit app aims to simplify the data analysis process by providing a user-friendly interface to perform common data analysis tasks.
Further, a Logistic Regression Model is used to find the placement of candidates and the app is hosted on streamlit
## Features

- Load and explore datasets
- Perform data preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Visualize data using various plots (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps)
- Train and evaluate machine learning models

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/streamlit-data-analysis-app.git
cd Placement_Predictor
```

### Create a Virtual Environment
#### macOS

Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following commands to create a virtual environment named `venv`:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run the following commands to create a virtual environment named `venv`:
```
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app using the following command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server, and you can access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
