 <h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
 <img src="https://atriainnovation.com/uploads/2023/11/portada-9.jpg" align="right">
  <p>    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ </p>
  <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that empowers systems to learn from data without explicit programming. ML algorithms analyze vast datasets to identify patterns, extract insights, and make predictions or decisions based on the derived knowledge.
  Unlike traditional programming, which relies on predefined rules, ML leverages statistical techniques and algorithms to enable systems to adapt and improve their performance over time. This adaptability allows ML to tackle complex problems in various domains, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.</p>
