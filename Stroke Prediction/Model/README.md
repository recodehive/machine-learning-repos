# Stroke Prediction Dataset 🧠

Welcome to the Stroke Prediction Dataset!  This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on various input parameters, including gender, age, medical history, and lifestyle factors. Stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), making it a significant public health concern.

## Context 

Stroke is a serious medical condition that occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, leading to damage or death of brain cells. This dataset provides relevant information about patients to predict their likelihood of experiencing a stroke. Each row in the data represents a patient, and various attributes are provided to aid in prediction.

## Attribute Information 

The dataset includes the following attributes:

1. **id**: Unique identifier for each patient.
2. **gender**: Gender of the patient (Male, Female, or Other).
3. **age**: Age of the patient.
4. **hypertension**: Indicates whether the patient has hypertension (0 if no, 1 if yes).
5. **heart_disease**: Indicates whether the patient has a heart disease (0 if no, 1 if yes).
6. **ever_married**: Indicates whether the patient is married (No or Yes).
7. **work_type**: Type of work the patient is engaged in (Children, Govt_job, Never_worked, Private, or Self-employed).
8. **Residence_type**: Type of residence (Rural or Urban).
9. **avg_glucose_level**: Average glucose level in the blood.
10. **bmi**: Body mass index (BMI).
11. **smoking_status**: Smoking status of the patient (Formerly smoked, Never smoked, Smokes, or Unknown).
12. **stroke**: Indicates whether the patient had a stroke (1 if yes, 0 if no).

## Inspiration 

This dataset can inspire research and analysis aimed at predicting stroke risk and implementing preventive measures. By analyzing the relationship between various demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors, researchers can develop accurate prediction models to identify individuals at high risk of stroke. Additionally, insights gained from this dataset can inform public health interventions and strategies to reduce the burden of stroke.
